NOTES

Shannon Hennessey

Position: Donovan Lab at Arizona State University

Summary: Studies Hawaiin coral reef threshold relaitonships between ecosystem indicators and human drivers
- to help with reef conservation and management

Intertidal research: 
  - easily accessible
  - easy to manipulate (exclusions, includions, removals, transplants)
  - organisms are resilient - adapt to harsh conditions
  - equipment is cheap!! - be creative
 
Shannon's Dissertation: _Nucella ostrina_ Highly variable: morphology, behaviour, diet 
  - welks are generalist predators 
  - goal: invesigate mechanism for establishing and maintaining individual diet variation in welks
      - across spatial scales, environmental predictability regimes, community level 
      - how does this influence how individuals navigate prey environment?

Individual level 
  - random movements are sufficnet for finding prefered prey - dont need to use energy to seek them out - some did select habitat based on prey preferences, lots of variation

Population level 
  - heritable efficiency helps somewhat in finding more prey

Community level 

Scientific Illustration!!

Two vital pieces of info 
How can you use during course
  - scientific illustration to help remember topics in class and engage a differnt part of the brain while learning!
    - helps to identify where some confusions may be held - adding colour can make the topics and theories come to life
  - observation is key - never stop observing natural systems! best way to learn. and ask lots of questions 
How can you use outside class
  - to solidify knowledge
  - for fun!
  - science communication - reach broad audiences
